                <p> Niklas Zennström was born February 16, 1966 in Jarfalla, Sweden.  He is best known for creating Skype and Kazaa.  Recently, he founded Atomico and has become a significant entrepreneur in online ventures.  He has dual degrees in Business Administration (BSc) and Engineering Physics(MSc) from Uppsala University in Sweden.  He spent his final year of college at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Currently he is CEO and Founding Partner at Atomico.  He is also the co-founder of the charity organization Zennström Philanthropies </p>

                <h2>Career</h2>

                <p> Zennström started his professional career in 1991 at the European telecom operator <strong>Tele2 </strong>. He went on to serve in various business development roles including launching and being responsible for European Internet Service Provider business get2net and as CEO of the everyday.com portal.</p>

                <h3> KaZaA </h3>

                <p> In 2000 Zennström and Janus Friis co-founded <strong>KaZaA </strong>, the peer-to-peer file sharing application. It was distributed for free, though it was notoriously loaded with adware (software that generates pop-up ads), spyware, and other malware applications that were secretly installed on users’ computers. Zennström and Friis had hoped to avoid the problems encountered by Napster, their company was sued almost immediately in Dutch courts for copyright infringement. Ordered in November 2001 to ensure that no copyrighted material was shared using <strong>KaZaA </strong>, the company was sold quickly to various interests, including the Australian company Sharman Networks. Subsequent lawsuits in the United States and Australia resulted in settlements of more than $100 million paid by Sharman, Zennström, and Friis.  Niklas served as CEO and the program became the world's most downloaded Internet software in 2003. After lawsuits were filed by members of the music and motion picture industry in the USA, <strong>KaZaA</strong> was sold to Sharman Networks.</p>

                <h3> Joltid </h3>

                <p>Zennström then founded and served as CEO at <strong>Joltid</strong>, a software company developing and marketing peer-to-peer solutions and traffic optimization technologies. Zennström also co-founded Altnet, the world's first secure peer-to-peer network promoting commercial content to consumers integrating promotion, distribution, and payment of digital content.</p>

                <h3> Skype</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/skype.jpg" alt="Skype Icon">

                </figure>

                <p> Zennström's most notable success to date is <strong>Skype</strong>, a telephony company based on peer-to-peer principles. It was developed in 2003.  On 14 October 2005, with more than 50 million users, <strong>Skype</strong> was acquired by eBay for €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion) plus the potential to earn further performance-based bonuses up to €1.2bn. Zennström was CEO from <strong>Skype's</strong> inception until September 2007. During that time, <strong>Skype</strong> became the global leader in Internet voice communications with more than 309 million registered users within five years of launch. In 2009 Zennström was part of the investment consortium that bought <strong>Skype</strong> Technologies from eBay and re-joined the <strong>Skype</strong> board. Currently, Zennström runs <strong>Atomico</strong>. Based in London, the firm primarily invests in fast growing tech companies with the ability to transform their respective industries. Through <strong>Atomico</strong> they have invested in over 50 companies on four continents, including Supercell, Rovio, Last.fm, FON, Rdio, Fab, Klarna and <strong>Skype</strong>.  On 10 May 2011 <strong>Skype</strong> was purchased by Microsoft for $8.5 billion in its biggest ever cash deal. It is reported that Zennström and Friis will make approximately $1 billion between them from the sale.</p>

                <h3> Joost</h3>

                <p> After the sale of <strong>Skype</strong>, Zennström went on in 2007 to launch <strong>Joost</strong>, an online video distribution service (where Zennström was co-chairman). In contrast with YouTube and its heavy reliance on short video clips uploaded by amateurs, <strong>Joost</strong> offered a wide selection of on-demand television shows from established broadcast and cable television content providers. Unlike <strong>Skype</strong>, <strong>Joost</strong> was designed to earn money through advertising, that money being shared with content providers, and, unlike <strong>KaZaA</strong>, <strong>Joost</strong> sought to protect copyrighted material for all content providers. A beta (test) version of <strong>Joost</strong> was made available to invited users in early 2007, and by the time of the official launch in May, <strong>Joost's</strong> sponsors included the <strong>Coca-Cola Company, Intel Corporation, Kraft Foods Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Nike Inc. However </strong>, <strong>Joost</strong> failed to become a serious competitor to <strong>YouTube, Netflix, Inc. </strong>, and <strong>Hulu</strong> in the Internet video market. In 2009 Zennström and Friis sold <strong>Joost</strong> to the American online advertising company Adconion Media Group. </p>

                <h3> Atomico</h3>

                <p> In 2006, <strong>Atomico</strong>, an international investment firm focused on the technology sector. The firm looks to invest in fast-growing technology companies that have innovative business models or are new enabling technologies. Headquartered in London with offices in Beijing, São Paulo, Tokyo and Istanbul, it has so far invested in more than 50 companies on four continents. Some of the team’s current and previous investments include category leaders such as Supercell,Rovio, Jawbone, FON, Fab, Klarna and Skype. </p>

                <h2>Honors and Awards</h2>

                <p> Zennström was recognized by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Most Influential People in 2006, and has received numerous other awards for innovation and entrepreneurship.  In 2006, he was voted Entrepreneur of the Year in the European Business Leaders Awards (EBLA).[4]  In October 2009, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, awarded Zennström the KTH Great Prize "for his outstanding entrepreneurial and technological skills".[5]  In September 2011, Zennström received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Oxford University's Oxford Internet Institute.[5]  In February 2013 Niklas Zennström was awarded H.M. The King’s Medal of 12th size with a bright blue ribbon for significant contributions to Swedish industry and society.[6]  In October 2013, the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, IVA, awarded Zennström the Gold Medal for his “highly successful entrepreneurial achievements, creative innovation, high technical competence and outstanding leadership”.[11] </p>

                <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surround yourself with smart, dedicated people - to build something isn't a one-man show. It's more important to have smart people who really believe in what you're doing than really experienced people who may not share your dream. [7]</li>
                    <li>If you want to be an entrepreneur, it's not a job, it's a lifestyle. It defines you. Forget about vacations, about going home at 6 pm - last thing at night you'll send emails, first thing in the morning you'll read emails, and you'll wake up in the middle of the night. But it's hugely rewarding as you're fulfilling something for yourself. [7]</li>
                    <li>I try not to dwell on big mistakes but to move on when I make a mistake. I make mistakes most of the times and that's part of the risk profile being an entrepreneur. I guess one big mistake I did was not to start my own company earlier. I spent nine years working for others before starting Kazaa in 2000. [7]</li>
                    <li>Angry Birds is one of the fastest-growing online products I've seen, growing even faster than Skype, and the company has done a brilliant job of extending it across different platforms and merchandise. [7]</li>
