                <a href="http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk">Stephen Henson</a> is a reserved, reclusive 46-year-old Brit with a Ph.D. in graph theory mathematics who lives in Staffordshire, England - — and the genius behind OpenSSL. He is responsible for around 60% of the code commits in the OpenSSL project.

                Since 1999, he has been working for practically nothing, adding features to and maintaining the OpenSSL project. He even spent 3 years pushing it through government certification only to have to almost entirely rewrite it over a weekend to finally get it approved.

                In computer networking, OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.

            </p>
            <p>

                Versions are available for most Unix-like operating systems (including Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X and the various open-source BSD operating systems), OpenVMS and Microsoft Windows. IBM provides a port for the System i (OS/400).

                OpenSSL is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSLeay">SSLeay by Eric Andrew Young and Tim Hudson</a>, development of which unofficially ended on December 17, 1998, when Young and Hudson both started to work for RSA Security.

            <h2>Project history</h2>

            <p>
                The OpenSSL project was founded in 1998 to invent a <strong>free</strong> set of encryption tools for the code used on the Internet. As of 2014 two thirds of all webservers use it. The OpenSSL project management team consists of four Europeans. The entire development group consists of 11 members, out of which 10 are volunteers; there is only one full-time employee, Stephen Henson, the lead developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project has a budget of less than $1 million a year and relies in part on donations. Steve Marquess, a former military consultant in Maryland started the foundation for donations and consultancy contracts and garnered sponsorship from the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Defense.

            <p>
                OpenSSL supports a number of different cryptographic algorithms:

            </ul>

            <p>
                (Perfect forward secrecy is supported using elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman since version 1.0.)

            </p>
            <p>
                As of December 2012, OpenSSL is one of two open source programs to be involved with validation under the FIPS 140-2 computer security standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). (OpenSSL itself is not validated, but a component called the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module, based on OpenSSL, was created to provide many of the same capabilities).
            </p>

            <p>
                A certificate was first awarded in January 2006 but revoked in July 2006 "when questions were raised about the validated module’s interaction with outside software." The certification was reinstated in February 2007.
            </p>

            <h2>Licensing</h2>
            <p>
                OpenSSL is "dual licensed" under the OpenSSL License and the SSLeay License. The OpenSSL License is Apache License 1.0 and SSLeay License bears some similarity to a 4-clause BSD License. The common usage of the term dual-license is that the user may pick which license they wish to use. However, OpenSSL documentation uses the term dual-license to mean that both licenses apply.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the OpenSSL License is Apache License 1.0, but not Apache License 2.0, it requires the phrase This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/) to appear in advertising material and any redistributions (Sections 3 and 6 of the OpenSSL License). Due to this restriction, the OpenSSL License and the Apache License 1.0 are incompatible with the GPL. Some GPL developers have added an OpenSSL exception to their licenses specifically allowing OpenSSL to be used with their system. GNU Wget and climm both use such exceptions. Some packages (like Deluge) explicitly modify the GPL license by adding an extra section at the beginning of the license documenting the exception. Other packages use the LGPL-licensed GnuTLS and MPL-licensed NSS, both of which perform the same task.
            </p>


            <h2>Heartbleed</h2>

            <p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/heartbleed.png" alt="Heartbleed"/>
                    <figcaption>Heartbleed Logo</figcaption>
                </figure>

                In April, 2014, OpenSSL fell victim to "Heartbleed". Heartbleed may be exploited regardless of whether the party using a vulnerable OpenSSL instance for TLS is a server or a client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension,[3] thus the bug's name derives from "heartbeat".[4] The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read,[5] a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.[6]
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time of disclosure, some 17% (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers certified by trusted authorities were believed to be vulnerable to the attack, allowing theft of the servers' private keys and users' session cookies and passwords.[8][9][10][11][12] The Electronic Frontier Foundation,[13] Ars Technica,[14] and Bruce Schneier[15] all deemed the Heartbleed bug "catastrophic". Forbes cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote, "Some might argue that [Heartbleed] is the worst vulnerability found (at least in terms of its potential impact) since commercial traffic began to flow on the Internet."[16]
